# Collections

>This support document covers creating and updating a *Collection*. To create and modify Page content for your *Collection Detail Page* see the [Pages](/admin/support/client/pages) support document.

*Collections* are groups of related Pages such as blog posts, recipes, services etc. and consist of *Collection Detail Pages* with each Page in the Collection accessible at a unique URL. Collections are ideal to categorize similar topics on your website.

Collection Detail Pages are accessed through a *Collection Summary* which is a group of links to your Collection Detail Pages for that Collection. Unlike a standard Page, the link to your published Collection Detail Page is automatically added to its Collection Summary.

Collection Summaries can be embedded in a Page Element, or the Collection Summary can be added to your website Navigation lists.

Before you can add a new Collection Detail Page, you must create at least one *Collection Group*.

## How to Create a New Collection Group
To create a new Collection Group, go to the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> **Settings** menu, then click on **Collection Groups**. Here you will see a list of existing Collection Groups. Then click on the **Add** menu in the top right corner and then select the **Collection** link.

In the form that appears enter the
- **Collection Title** To describe the collection. This is the text that will appear in your website that refers to this Collection Group.
- **Collection Slug** The URL segment for the Collection.
- **Collection Template** The design *Template* to use for all Collection Detail Pages in this Collection.

The *Collection Slug* is the unique segment in the URL (the text between slashes `/`) that comes after your domain and before the Page Slug, and is initially based on the Page Title. You can modify the Slug if you wish to provide clarity or brevity.

>Note: to change the Slug after the Page is Published you must first click the <i class="fas fa-lock"></i> lock icon and acknowledge the warning. Changing the Slug after the Page is published may break links to your Page!

>Note: once a Detail Page has been added to the Collection, you can no longer change the Template used for the Collection Detail Pages.

## How to Edit an Existing Collection Group
To edit a Collection Group, go to the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> **Settings** menu then click on **Collection Groups**. Then click on the row for the Collection you wish to edit.

Click **Save** to save your changes, or click **Discard** to reset your changes.

## How to Delete a Collection Group
Once a Collection Detail Page has been added to the Collection, you can no longer delete the Collection Group. You must first remove all Collection Detail Pages in this Collection before deleting the Collection Group.

To delete a Collection Group, go to the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> **Settings** menu then click on **Collection Groups**. Click on the row for the Collection Group and then click on **Delete Collection** and acknowledge the warning prompt.

## Sharing the Collection Summary
To share links to your Collection Group, you can either

- Add a *Collection Element* to a standard Page, or
- Add the Collection Group to a main Navigation List, or
- Do both

By using a Collection Element on a standard Page, you can create a landing page to introduce this Collection topic. To use a Collection Element

1. Create or edit the standard Page that will show the Collection Summary.
2. Click on **Add Element** in the desired *Block*, and select then select **Collection** as the Element type.
3. Add an optional **Element Title** and **Element Content** to introduce the Collection
4. Select the name of the Collection to display from the drop down list
5. Save the Page by clicking **Save**

As you add new Collection Detail Pages, the Pages links will automatically appear in your Collection Summary.
