# Messages

You website may have a contact form for visitors to submit messages. This is a design consideration set by your website designer. If configured, when visitors submit a message you will receive an email with the message, and a copy of the message will be kept in PitonCMS for reference.

## Configure Messages
To display a contact form you need to select a Contact Element in your page (if configured by your designer).

* Go to **Pages** and edit or create a page with a template block enabled with Contact Form.
* Click Add Element > Contact, and then optionally add a Title and some leading text Content.
* Save the page, and ensure it is Published.

You can configure some contact message options under Settings > Contact to have messages forwarded by email, the response message to display, and the minimum message length. See [Contact Settings Support](/admin/support/client/settings#contact) for more information.

## Manage Messages in PitonCMS

All submitted messages are kept in PitonCMS for reference. The number of new messages are indicated next to the **Messages** navigation link. You can mark messages as read, or as unread, and delete messages if you wish.

**To View** Go to Messages. The default view is unread.

**To Change Read Status** Click the *Read* or *Unread* button next to the message.

**To Delete** Click the red *Delete* button next to the message. This action is final, and the message cannot be recovered.
