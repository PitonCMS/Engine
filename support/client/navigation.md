# Navigation

When visitors land on your website, they need a way to find your content; this is the role of *Navigation* lists. Navigation lists are the sets of links to internal Pages. Your web design may have one or more Navigation lists that you can update.

Standard [published](/admin/support/client/pages#saving-and-publishing) Pages will need a link manually added to the Navigation lists for visitors to find the Page. ([Collection Pages](/admin/support/client/collections) have links shared by Collection Summaries.)

Search engines also use these Navigation lists to browse your website, so having links to all Pages is essential. Furthermore, like humans search engines will read and evaluate the link text to determine if the destination is of interest. PitonCMS allows you to add internal and external links to Navigation lists, to modify the link text, to change the order of links, and even categorize links into dropdown menus.

## Hot to Edit a Navigation List

To edit a Navigation list, go to <i class="fas fa-compass"></i> **Navigation** menu. You will then see links to the different Navigation lists for your web design, such as *Main* or *Primary* or *Footer* etc. Click on the Navigation list you wish to modify.

Here you can add, delete, or rename Navigation links.

The Navigation Editor has two panels
- Links you can add to your list (on the left)
- The current Navigation list you are editing (on the right)

On the left there are three types of links you can add to your Navigation list
- **Pages** Standard Pages (both published and not published)
- **Collections** Collection Groups
- **Placeholder** Custom links

On the right is your current Navigation list where you can edit link text, and you can move link position by dragging and dropping links.

After making your changes you can click **Save** or click **Discard** to reset any changes.

>**Note**: Deleting links is permanent and immediate.

## How to Add a Page or Collection Summary Link
A Page must first exist before it can be added to a Navigation list.

To add a link

 1. In the **Pages** or **Collections** sections on the left, check the box next to the Page or Collection you wish to add
 2. Click the **Add Page** or **Add Collection** button
 3. The new link will appear at the bottom of the Navigation list on the right
 4. (Optional) Modify the link text
 5. (Optional) Drag and drop the new link into the desired position
 6. Click **Save** to save your changes

Because your Collection links will automatically grow as you publish Collection Detail Pages, it is recommended that you add Collections as a sub-Navigation list under a Placeholder link. This way the new Collection Detail Pages do not crowd your Navigation list display.

>**Note**: You can add a link to an unpublished Page. However, the Navigation list will not display the link in the Navigation list until that Page is published.

## How to Add a Placeholder Link
The *Placeholder* link option can be useful to share

- Custom links to external sites
- As a placeholder parent of a sub-Navigation list or Collection

To add a Placeholder link

1. Enter the link text in the **Placeholder** section
2. (Optional) Enter the link URL (can be blank if just a placeholder)
3. (Optional) Drag and drop the new link into the desired position
4. Click **Save** to save your changes

To use a Placeholder as the parent of a sub-Navigation
1. Add the Placeholder link and enter a suitable link title.
2. Then add the sub-Navigation pages and drag them *under* the Placeholder.
3. Click **Save** to save your changes

## How to Delete Navigation Links

You can permanently remove a Navigation link or Placeholder link from your website.

To permanently delete a Navigation link
1. Click on the <i class="fas fa-compass"></i> **Navigation** menu and then click on the Navigation list you wish to modify
2. Open the link by clicking on the <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i> down arrow
3. Click the **Remove** button and acknowledge the warning to delete the link

>**Note**: Deleting a link is permanent and immediate, and cannot be undone.

>**Note**: Although the deleted Navigation links will no longer appear on your website, if the target Page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view that Page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a page to remove page content entirely.

You cannot delete the Navigation list itself, only your website designer can remove or add Navigation lists.
