# Navigation

When visitors land on your website, they need a way to find your content; this is the role of *Navigation* lists. Navigation lists are the sets of links to internal Pages. Your web design may have one or more Navigation lists that you can update.

Standard [published](/admin/support/client/pages#saving-and-publishing) Pages will need a link manually added to the Navigation lists for visitors to find the Page. ([Collection Pages](/admin/support/client/collections) have links shared by Collection Summaries.)

Search engines also use these Navigation lists to browse your website, so having links to all Pages is essential. Furthermore, like humans search engines will read and evaluate the link text to determine if the destination is of interest. PitonCMS allows you to add internal and external links to Navigation lists, to modify the link text, to change the order of links, and even categorize links into dropdown menus.

## Hot to Edit a Navigation List

To edit a Navigation list, go to <i class="fas fa-compass"></i> **Navigation** menu. You will then see links to the different Navigation lists for your web design, such as *Main* or *Primary* or *Footer* etc. Click on the Navigation list you wish to modify.

Here you can add, delete, or rename Navigation links.

The Navigation Editor has two panels
- Links you can add to your list (on the left)
- The current Navigation list you are editing (on the right)

On the left there are three types of links you can add to your Navigation list
- **Pages** Standard Pages (both published and not published)
- **Collections** Collection Groups
- **Placeholder** Custom links

On the right is your current Navigation list where you can edit link text, and you can move link position by dragging and dropping links.

After making your changes you can click **Save** or click **Discard** to reset any changes.

>**Note**: Deleting links is permanent and immediate.

## How to Add a Page or Collection Summary Link
A Page must first exist before it can be added to a Navigation list.

To add a link

 1. In the **Pages** or **Collections** sections on the left, check the box next to the Page or Collection you wish to add
 2. Click the **Add Page** or **Add Collection** button
 3. The new link will appear at the bottom of the Navigation list on the right
 4. (Optional) Modify the link text
 5. (Optional) Drag and drop the new link into the desired position
 6. Click **Save** to save your changes

Because your Collection links will automatically grow as you publish Collection Detail Pages, it is recommended that you add Collections as a sub-Navigation list under a Placeholder link. This way the new Collection Detail Pages do not crowd your Navigation list display.

>**Note**: You can add a link to an unpublished Page. However, the Navigation list will not display the link in the Navigation list until that Page is published.

## How to Add a Placeholder Link
The *Placeholder* link option can be useful to share

- Custom links to external sites
- As a placeholder parent of a sub-Navigation list or Collection

To add a Placeholder link

1. Enter the link text in the **Placeholder** section
2. (Optional) Enter the link URL (can be blank if just a placeholder)
3. (Optional) Drag and drop the new link into the desired position
4. Click **Save** to save your changes

To use a Placeholder as the parent of a sub-Navigation
1. Add the Placeholder link and enter a suitable link title.
2. Then add the sub-Navigation pages and drag them *under* the Placeholder.
3. Click **Save** to save your changes

## How to Disable Navigation Links

You can temporarily disable a Navigation link or sub-Navigation list to hide the link on your website.

>**Note**: although the deactivated Navigation links will not appear on the website, if the target Page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view the Page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a Page to hide it completely.

To disable a Navigation link

1. Click the yellow deactivate icon. The selected link should turn amber (including any sub page links).
2. Click the save button.

To enable a navigation link

1. Click the *Disable* icon again to the left of the arrows. The highlighted color will disappear.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

## Delete Navigation Links

You can permanently remove a navigation page link or dropdown from the website.

Note, although the deleted navigation links will not appear on the website, if the target Page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view that page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a page to remove page content entirely.

To permanently delete a navigation link

1. Click the garbage can or bin icon to the right of the arrows. The selected link should turn red.
    * If the deleted link is the parent of a Dropdown, the entire dropdown will be deleted.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

You cannot delete the navigation list itself, only your website designer can remove or add navigator groups. You can, however, remove all links from a navigator group.

The navigation manager allows you to

* Add a page to any navigator (but not collection detail pages)
* Set the desired position of the link
* Edit the link text (defaults to the page title)
* Add a dropdown menu to a list of child links
* Deactivate a link temporarily to remove it without deleting the link entry

To edit a navigator, go to **Content > Navigation > Edit [Navigator Name].

Here you can add, delete, rename, and deactivate or reactivate navigation links. Make your changes, and the press save.

**Note**: When clicking delete on a navigation link, the link is not immediately deleted, it is marked for deletion (and turns red). The delete happens when the navigator is saved.
