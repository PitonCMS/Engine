# PitonCMS Home

PitonCMS is an easy to use, powerful Content Management System for personal and business websites.

## Login
PitonCMS does not store confidential passwords. When your website was setup by your designer, your email address was added as a registered email. To login, simply go to your website and add [/login](/login) to the URL.

Enter your email address and click *Request Login*. A link will be sent to your personal email with a one-time use login token that takes you to this administration page. The link expires in 5 minutes, and cannot be reused.

## Quick Start

If you are new to your custom website, here are a few things to start with:

* Go to Tools > Settings. Browse these site-wide settings and confirm the values. You should consider getting a Tinify image compression key [https://tinyjpg.com/](Tiny). The license key is free for the first 500 image compressions per month.
* Go to Tools > Contact. If you have a contact form on your website enter your email address to share website contact messages, and the acknowledgement message after the form is submitted.
* Go to Tools > Social. Here you can save links to your social media sites.
* Go to Tools > Users. Consider adding another user account, or a back up administrator email address.
* Go to Media to add some images for use in your pages.
* Browse the help documents.

## PitonCMS Structure

PitonCMS is meant to be user friendly *and* designer friendly. Most of the website structure is setup by the designer when they construct your website, but allows the user an easy way to maintain content without breaking design. If you feel your custom website is missing something, just ask your designer - most likely they can easily support you.
