# PitonCMS Navigation

With the PitonCMS Navigation manager, you can control which **Page** links appear and in what order in any navigation list. Your website designer will have predefined the navigation lists, such as in the header, footer, sidebar, etc. However, you can then add or remove links to any **Page** to any one of the navigation lists.

## Navigators

The list of navigation lists on the left are defined by the website designer. To add or remove a new navigator, contact the designer.

To edit a **Navigator** click on the name in the left sidebar.

## Add Page

A **Page** must first exist before it can be added to a navigator. To add and position a navigation link:

1. Select the **Navigator** to edit from the left sidebar.
2. From the dropdown menu at the bottom of the editor, select the desired **Page**.
   * Once selected the page will appear at the bottom of the navigation list.
3. Use the arrows to move the page link to the desired position.
4. By default, the link name is the page title. If desired, enter a link name in the *Navigation title* field (optional).
5. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

The link should now be visible.

## Dropdown Navigation

A page link can be moved under a parent link to create a dropdown menu effect. The parent link of the dropdown can be either a link to an actual **Page**, or a placeholder non-link above a list of page links.

To add a dropdown menu navigation:

1. Ensure you have the parent (top) dropdown menu navigator.
   * To use a non-link, select *[Dropdown]* from the Add Page list at the bottom, and then move that dropdown placeholder into position.
2. Select the first sub-page link from the Add Page list at the bottom of the editor.
3. Move the sub-page to just under the parent link.
4. Click the right arrow to indent the sub-page under the parent link.
5. Repeat as necessary.
6. Re-order the sub-pages using the up and down arrows as necessary.
7. Optional: Enter link titles if the page title is too long.
8. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

## Disable Navigation Links

You can temporarily disable a page navigation link or dropdown to hide that entry on the website.

Note, although the deactivated navigation links will not appear on the website, if the target Page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view that page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a page to remove page content entirely.

To disable a navigation link:

1. Click the *Disable* icon to the left of the arrows. The selected link should turn amber.
    * If the disabled link is the parent of a Dropdown, the entire dropdown will be disabled.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

1. Click the *Disable* icon again to the left of the arrows. The highlighted color will disappear.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

## Delete Navigation Links
