# PitonCMS Navigation

With the **PitonCMS Navigation** manager, you can control which **Page** links appear and in what order in any navigator group links list. Your website designer will have predefined the navigator link groups, such as header, footer, sidebar, etc. However, you can then add or remove links to any Page in the navigation lists.

Note, **Collection** Pages will not appear in the navigator links. Instead, you will add an **Collection Element** to one of your Pages as the entry point to that Collection.

## Navigators

The navigator groups on the left are defined by your website designer. To remove or add a new navigator group, contact the designer.

To edit a navigator click on the name in the left sidebar.

## Add Page Link

A Page must first exist before it can be added to a navigator. To add and position a Page link:

1. Select the **Navigator** to edit from the left sidebar.
2. From the dropdown menu at the bottom of the editor, select the desired Page.
   * Once selected, the page will appear at the bottom of the current navigation list.
3. Use the arrows to move the page link to the desired position.
4. By default, the link name is the page title. If desired, enter a link name in the *Navigation title* field (optional).
5. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

The link should now be visible.

## Dropdown Navigation Links

A page link can be moved under a parent link to create a dropdown menu effect (if your theme supports this). The parent link of the dropdown can be either a link to an actual **Page**, or a placeholder non-link.

To add a dropdown menu navigation:

1. Select the **Navigator** to edit from the left sidebar.
2. Ensure you have the parent (top) dropdown menu link set.
   * To use a non-link, select **[Dropdown]** from the Add Page list at the bottom, and then move that Dropdown placeholder into position.
3. Select the first sub-page link from the Add Page list at the bottom of the editor.
4. Using the arrows, move the sub-page to just under the parent link.
5. Click the right arrow to indent the sub-page under the parent link.
6. Repeat as necessary.
7. Re-order the sub-pages using the up and down arrows as necessary.
8. By default, the link name is the page title. If desired, enter a link name in the *Navigation title* field (optional).
9. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

## Disable Navigation Links

You can temporarily disable a page navigation link or dropdown to hide that entry on the website.

Note, although the deactivated navigation links will not appear on the website, if the target page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view that page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a page to remove page content entirely.

To disable a navigation link:

1. Click the *Disable* icon to the left of the arrows. The selected link should turn amber.
    * If the disabled link is the parent of a Dropdown, the entire dropdown list will be disabled.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

To enable a navigation link:

1. Click the *Disable* icon again to the left of the arrows. The highlighted color will disappear.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

## Delete Navigation Links

You can permanently remove a navigation page link or dropdown from the website.

Note, although the deleted navigation links will not appear on the website, if the target Page is still *Published* visitors and search engines may still be able view that page if they have the URL. Use the unpublish feature on a page to remove page content entirely.

To permanently delete a navigation link:

1. Click the garbage can or bin icon to the right of the arrows. The selected link should turn red.
    * If the deleted link is the parent of a Dropdown, the entire dropdown will be deleted.
2. Click the *Save Navigation* button.

You cannot delete the navigation list itself, only your website designer can remove or add navigator groups. You can, however, remove all links from a navigator group.
