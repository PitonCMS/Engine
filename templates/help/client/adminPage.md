# PitonCMS Pages and Collections

A *Page* contains content at a specific URL. Unlike a *Collection*, which represents a group of Pages with a common theme, a **Page** is best used for standalone content.

Here you can find a list of existing pages in your website, or create a new page.

On the left you will see a list of Page *Templates*.
