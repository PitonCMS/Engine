# PitonCMS for Designers

PitonCMS was designed to be _Designer Forward_, giving great flexibility to the designer to build creative websites without requiring additional custom backend development.

Page structures, custom data, settings, are all easily extensible by modifying project JSON **Definition** files. These files can be checked into version control and pushed to other environments to promote layout and data changes without having to modify remote databases or push code.
