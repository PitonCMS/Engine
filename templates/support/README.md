# PitonCMS Support Files Structure

Support files consist of one markdown file for each topic, divided between subjects (client and designer).

The filename is passed as a parameter to the `/support/{subject}/{file}` route without the `.md` extension.

The markdown file is rendered to HTML at runtime.

PitonCMS more or less uses the Microsoft Technical style guide for formatting and marking up support content.

For the support article outline, PitonCMS uses the Digital Ocean conceptual template.

## Outline
Support articles should have a title, possibly an introduction, and may have steps or sections before a conclusion (optional).

- Article Title (Level 1 heading, in Title Case)
- Introduction (Level 3 heading), optional
- Doing the First Thing (Level 2 heading)
- Doing the Next Thing (Level 2 heading)
- â€¦
- Doing the Last Thing (Level 2 heading)
- Conclusion (Level 2 heading), optional

Try to avoid using Level 4 headings, and use Level 3 sparingly.

## Formatting


**Piton Terminology**
Italicize the first mention of a Piton term within an article and include a definition, and capitalize the remainder.
