# PitonCMS Support Files Structure

Support files consist of one markdown file for each topic, divided between subjects (client and designer).

The filename is passed as a parameter to the `/support/{subject}/{file}` route without the `.md` extension.

The markdown file is rendered to HTML at runtime.

PitonCMS uses the Digital Ocean style guide to formatting and marking up support content.
